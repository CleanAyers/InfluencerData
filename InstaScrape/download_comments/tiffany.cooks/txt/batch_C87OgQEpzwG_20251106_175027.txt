erespo07: as a cancer survivor, seeing someone going through cancer and has an appetite is very rewarding to see! during my treatments, I preferred to eat sunflower seeds and pickles. I don't know why, but I could eat a whole jar for the whole week! but when I got home, it was beef fajita tacos and chips n' queso and this super eggroll that my local food court mall used to make. whatever he wants, please go and get it for him! and I pray for a speedy positive diagnosis and a speedy recovery!

hanan.995: I just lost my father to cancer two weeks ago.
I can assure you that food does make a difference and help the body recover.. hold on to those moments of appetite and make sure he eats whatever he wants.. don’t cut down on anything.
During chemo, my dad was mainly craving sugary foods and seafood.
I thought sugar was bad for him so I tried to replace it with a “better for him alternatives” until he completely lost his appetite.
Sometimes the body’s cravings are part of its healing, the body always knows what it needs.
Please avoid making the same mistake
Also, a very helpful tip is to give him fresh juices on the days he isn’t eating. (I include beetroot in almost everything) that way he at least gets his dose of nutrients.
Sending you all the love and support and he will get through it inshallah 🤲🏼❤️‍🩹 #CancerSucks
